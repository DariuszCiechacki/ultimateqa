# Project Name: Automation Testing for UltimateQA platform

# Description: 
This project is designed to run automated tests on the Ultimate QA platform. Its primary goal is to demonstrate my expertise in automation testing using Selenium WebDriver and my programming capabilities in Java. 
Through a series of structured tests, the project aims to validate various functionalities within the Ultimate QA platform, ensuring that each component behaves as expected.

# Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Java
Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver
Testing Framework: JUnit
Build Tool: Maven

# Key Features:
Comprehensive Test Coverage: Targets key features of the Ultimate QA platform, ensuring thorough validation.
Page Object Model (POM): Enhances test maintenance and readability.
DTO with Faker: Generates test data for forms, improving test realism and coverage.
Streams: Streamlines iteration over lists for efficient data processing.
File Operations: Demonstrates capability with file creation and deletion, useful for test evidence or data handling.
JUnit Assertions: Ensures accurate test outcomes, validating functionality as expected.
Secure Configurations: Safely stores and retrieves user credentials, enhancing security.
Cross-Browser Testing: Expands test coverage across multiple browsers for comprehensive compatibility checks.

# Java/Selenium WebDriver Methods Utilized:
This section lists some of the key Java and Selenium WebDriver methods used in this project, along with the classes they can be found in. 
This is not an exhaustive list but highlights the variety and complexity of the techniques applied.

Maps: For storing element locators and configurations, demonstrating proficiency with complex data structures.
Lists: Manages collections of web elements, showcasing handling of dynamic web elements. 
Loops: Utilized for iterative operations.
Enums and Interfaces: Standardizes test parameters and structures test development for clarity and maintainability.
DTO: Facilitates efficient data transfer within tests, essential for managing complex test states. 

# Installation:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ultimate-qa-automation.git
2. Install Maven dependencies: mvn install
3. To run specific test use following command: mvn clean test -Dtest="OpenHomePageTest" (replace "OpenHomePageTest" with desired test name)

# Upcoming Features:
Parallel Execution: To reduce test run times through concurrent test execution.
Test Suites: Organizing tests into suites for better management and execution.
CI/CD Integration: Automating test runs within CI/CD pipelines for continuous quality assurance.
Headless Test Execution: Offering headless mode execution for faster and resource-efficient testing.
