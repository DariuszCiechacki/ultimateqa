# Project Name: Automation Testing for UltimateQA platform

# Description: 
This project is designed to run automated tests on the Ultimate QA platform. Its primary goal is to demonstrate my expertise in automation testing using Selenium WebDriver and my programming capabilities in Java. \
Through a series of structured tests, the project aims to validate various functionalities within the Ultimate QA platform, ensuring that each component behaves as expected.

# Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Java\
Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver\
Testing Framework: JUnit\
Build Tool: Maven

# Key Features:
Comprehensive Test Coverage: Targets key features of the Ultimate QA platform, ensuring thorough validation.\
Page Object Model (POM): Enhances test maintenance and readability.\
DTO with Faker: Generates test data for forms, improving test realism and coverage.\
Streams: Streamlines iteration over lists for efficient data processing.\
File Operations: Demonstrates capability with file creation and deletion, useful for test evidence or data handling.\
JUnit Assertions: Ensures accurate test outcomes, validating functionality as expected.\
Secure Configurations: Safely stores and retrieves user credentials, enhancing security.\
Cross-Browser Testing: Expands test coverage across multiple browsers for comprehensive compatibility checks.\
Headless Testing: Enables tests to run in a headless mode, facilitating faster execution times and resource optimization for continuous integration environments.
GitHub CI/CD Integration: Integrates with GitHub's CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated builds and tests to ensure code quality and reliability with every push to master branch. 

# Java/Selenium WebDriver Methods Utilized:
This section lists some of the key Java and Selenium WebDriver methods used in this project, along with the classes they can be found in. \
This is not an exhaustive list but highlights the variety and complexity of the techniques applied.

Maps: For storing element locators and configurations, demonstrating proficiency with complex data structures.\
Lists: Manages collections of web elements, showcasing handling of dynamic web elements. \
Loops: Utilized for iterative operations.\
Enums and Interfaces: Standardizes test parameters and structures test development for clarity and maintainability.\
DTO: Facilitates efficient data transfer within tests, essential for managing complex test states.

# Installation:
1. Clone the project to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ultimate-qa-automation.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd ultimate-qa-automation 
3. Install the necessary dependencies with Maven: mvn install 
4. To execute a specific test, use the command. Replace "OpenHomePageTest" with the name of the test class you wish to run: mvn clean test -Dtest="OpenHomePageTest"
5. The tests are set to run on Chrome by default. To specify a different browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox), append -Dbrowser=yourBrowserChoice to your command. For example, to run tests on Firefox: mvn clean test -Dbrowser=firefox -Dtest="OpenHomePageTest"
6. For headless execution, which is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines or environments without a GUI, add -Dheadless=true to your command: mvn clean test -Dheadless=true -Dtest="OpenHomePageTest"

# Upcoming Features:
Parallel Execution: To reduce test run times through concurrent test execution.\
Test Suites: Organizing tests into suites for better management and execution.\
Report Tool: Integrate project with report tool to have a clear view which tests failed\
